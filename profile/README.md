# The project
The HELPMI project wants to start the development of a data and metadata standard (meta-standard) for high-intensity laser-plasma experiment data.
We want to extend [openPMD](https://github.com/openPMD) for custom hierarchies and investigate to which extend the [NeXus-format](https://github.com/nexpy/nexusformat) can be adopted for the scientific domain of laser-plasma experiments.

Further information can be found at [our website](www.laser-plasma-metadata.org).

## The team
We are scientist from [GSI](www.gsi.de), [HI-Jena](https://www.hi-jena.de) and [HZDR](www.hzdr.de).

## Support
This work is part of the [HELPMI project](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en/inf-projects/helpmi-helmholtz-laser-plasma-metadata-initiative) of the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration [HMC](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en). This project (ZT-I-PF-3-066) was funded by the Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association in the framework of the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration project call.
