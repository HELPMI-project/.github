The HELPMI project wants to start the development of a data and metadata standard (meta-standard) for high-intensity laser-plasma experiment data.

This work is part of the [HELPMI project](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en/inf-projects/helpmi-helmholtz-laser-plasma-metadata-initiative) of the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration [HMC](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en). This project (ZT-I-PF-3-066) was funded by the Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association in the framework of the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration project call.
